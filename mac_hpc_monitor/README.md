# BJTU HPC macOS Monitor

Lightweight macOS monitors for saved BJTU HPC accounts.

Both monitors poll the existing helper command:

```bash
hpc_queue_summary.py --json
```

The default account cap is `4` non-terminal jobs: two Slurm running-job slots plus two queued follow-ups. The menu bar title shows total running and pending jobs, for example:

```text
HPC R6/10 Q5
```

The menu is organized as:

```text
DASHBOARD
RUN 6/10   JOBS 11/20   WAIT 5

ACCOUNTS
main    FULL    R2/2  J4/4  Q2
other   FULL    R2/2  J4/4  Q2
account_c   ROOM    R2/2  J3/4  Q1
account_c     IDLE    R0/2  J0/4  Q0
```

Each account opens a submenu with token time, pending reason, and compact job rows. It does not display portal tokens, passwords, cookies, or temporary SSH certificates.

## Desktop Widget

The graphical widget is a compact floating, draggable desktop panel with account cards, status colors, and running GPU/CPU totals.

Account rows use this compact shape:

```text
main   Run 2   G2 C8    Jobs 4/4   Wait 2
account_c  Run 2   G4 C32   Jobs 3/4   Wait 1
```

Preview:

```bash
./hpc_desktop_widget.py --preview /tmp/bjtu_hpc_widget_preview.png
```

Launch manually:

```bash
./make_widget_app_bundle.sh
open "BJTU HPC Widget.app"
```

Install at login:

```bash
./install_hpc_desktop_widget.sh
```

Uninstall:

```bash
./uninstall_hpc_desktop_widget.sh
```

Right-click the widget to open the dashboard or quit. Drag anywhere on the widget to move it.
Click the pin icon in the top-right corner to toggle Always On Top; the choice is saved in
`~/Library/Application Support/BJTUHPCWidget/config.json`.
Use the right-click `All Desktops` toggle to choose whether the widget follows every
macOS desktop/Space. Keep it off if you want to move the widget to another Space through
Mission Control.
The right-click menu also includes `Auto Token Login`. When enabled, the dashboard Token
Guardian can automatically open a visible Playwright login window for accounts whose token
needs attention. You still need to enter the CAS captcha/verification code and close the
browser window after the HPC portal loads. `Open Token Login` manually opens visible login
windows for accounts currently marked as token-risky. A purple account name in the widget is
also clickable and opens the visible login window for that account only.
By default the widget is pinned only on the current macOS desktop/Space. Set
`HPC_WIDGET_ALL_SPACES=1` before installing or launching, or use the right-click toggle, if
it should follow all Spaces.
The bottom-right legend maps account-name colors: green `full`, blue `room`,
amber `open`, purple `token` for accounts that need token refresh, and red
`err` for non-auth query or network errors.

```

Uninstall:

```bash
./uninstall_hpc_menubar_monitor.sh
```

```

## Configuration

Set environment variables before launching or installing:

```bash
export HPC_MONITOR_INTERVAL=60
export HPC_MONITOR_MAX_INTERVAL=600
export HPC_MONITOR_TIMEOUT=45
export HPC_MONITOR_ACCOUNT_CAP=4
export HPC_MONITOR_ACCOUNTS=account_a,account_b,account_c,account_d,account_e
export HPC_MONITOR_ALL_PARTITIONS=0
export HPC_WIDGET_WIDTH=320
export HPC_WIDGET_HEIGHT=466
export HPC_WIDGET_ALWAYS_ON_TOP=1
export HPC_WIDGET_ALL_SPACES=0
```

Defaults are suitable for the local helper workspace.

`HPC_MONITOR_INTERVAL` is the base refresh interval. The monitors compare a
stable state signature after each refresh; if jobs and cluster GPU/CPU resources
are unchanged, the next interval grows linearly up to
`HPC_MONITOR_MAX_INTERVAL`. Any job-state change, pending-reason change, or
cluster node GPU/CPU allocation/free-count change resets the interval to the
base value.

The desktop widget also shows GPU-node resource usage from native Slurm
`scontrol show node`; active reservation nodes are excluded from the displayed
GPU/CPU totals and node list.

The Token Guardian sends macOS notifications when headless token refresh fails
repeatedly or a saved token becomes old enough to be risky. Defaults are 3
consecutive headless failures and a 5-day token age warning. Auto-opening
visible login windows is disabled by default and can be toggled from the widget
or dashboard.

## Resource History

The menu bar monitor and desktop widget record each changed queue/resource
snapshot to:

```text
work/hpc_resource_history.jsonl
```

Each record is redacted and contains requested GPU/CPU shape, job state,
pending reason, submit/start timing when available, and the same GPU-node
resource snapshot shown by the widget. Unchanged snapshots are skipped by a
small state file at `work/hpc_resource_history.state.json`.

Backfill recent native Slurm snapshots that were already saved under
`hpc_stdout/`:

```bash
python3 hpc_resource_history.py --backfill-days 14 --summary
```

Disable monitor-side recording with:

```bash
export HPC_MONITOR_RECORD_HISTORY=0
```
